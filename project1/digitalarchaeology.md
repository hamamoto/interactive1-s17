**Digital Archeology**

---

**Overview**

This project investigates contemporary aesthetics in the Internet.

Computer graphics respond to the evolution of computational power in relation to user’s needs and desires. They are the results of collaboration and compromises between designers, engineers, computer users and corporate interests.

Design for the web operates within these parameters – constantly in-flux as new technologies, platforms, and social trends emerge and recalibrate to one and another.

And while many of these factors are outside of the designers control, graphics are a crucial component of the web as they communicate both the content and the structure of the spaces we navigate. Often, the design of an interface will prescribe or enable visual form in unexpected ways.

Increasingly, we see visual form take on memetic traits. Through the adaptation of new standards within interface design, to the spread of viral images via social networks.

With an archeologist mindset we will track the technical and cultural reasons of the current state of graphics online. Creating taxonomies and timelines of forms and features, we will look at how design principles can been implemented but also misused in inventive ways. 


**Learning Outcomes**
* Identify the current state of internet aesthetics, and understand the technical, social, and historical context that led to these conditions.
* Develop a sensibility to the unstable technological landscape.
* Learn basic HTML and CSS to produce simple webpages.

**Requirements**
* 5 minute presentation on your topic
* Online interface to showcase a collection of 50 images / graphics / forms
* A digital(?) artifact recontextualizing your collection

**Reading**
* A Vernacular Web, Oliana Lialina   
* Interface Aesthetics: An Introduction, Jason Huff
* The Meme, Metahaven

**Step 1**

Identify the basis for a taxonomy to investigate. This could range from a specific UI element (loading spinners, sprite sheets, under construction gifs, captchas), to a category of communication (image macros, status updates, emojis), to a time period, or anything in between.

When identifying your collection, consider the social context in which it exists. Does internet load times influence the visual forms of these items? Does a subgroup, political agenda, or technological limitation prescribe certain attributes?

Prepare a 5 minute presentation on your collection and its history.
