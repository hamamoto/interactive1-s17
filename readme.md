### Description
Designing for the internet requires a solution that embraces the web as a communication medium while providing for a unique user experience. 
The goal is to strike a balance between form and function, between visual design and effective communication. This course will cover the latest methods of web design, development, and production including HTML, CSS, and beyond. 
From beginners to those with more experience, students will learn the most current techniques for planning, designing, building and testing a fully functional website start to finish. 
Along the way, you’ll be introduced to relevant readings, conduct in-class tutorials, and be provided challenging exercises and projects to deepen your awareness of graphic design principles in tandem with web based practice and technology.
